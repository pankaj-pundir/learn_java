# Learn OOP's
- new object should be created within the main method to use other objects of the same class.
- final	The class cannot be inherited by other classes
- abstract	The class cannot be used to create objects 
    - An abstract method belongs to an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass:

- synchronized	Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
- just like static attributes and methods, a static inner class does not have access to members of the outer class.

- Abstract class

    - abstraction can also be achieved with interfaces

- Interface 
    - Java does not support "multiple inheritance" (a class can only inherit from one superclass). However, it can be achieved with interfaces, because the class can implement multiple interfaces.
