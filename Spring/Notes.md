Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation. It simplifies the build process like ANT.

Gradle is more powerful. However, there are times that you really do not need most of the features and functionalities it offers. Maven might be best for small projects, while Gradle is best for bigger projects.
